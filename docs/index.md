# DSA (Javascript)

## Getting Started

In this website, I'll work on my notes about several topics:

- [JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms](./JavaScript/)

## How I generate this website
I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website!

All mathematical equations are rendered by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), and I added `overflow-x: auto` to prevent overflow issue on small screen devices, so you can scroll horizontally in some math display equations.
